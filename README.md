# Medical Image Server

The program builds a medical image server. With the GUI, user can
- Upload an image
- Display an image
- Download an image
- Process an image, i.e. invert an image
- Compare two images

The server is hosted on duke vm: `vcm-14274.vm.duke.edu`. User can git clone the project and run `python client.py` to open the GUI. [Here](https://duke.box.com/s/35v55xjgo1h8ncj3slcc1p7swk6cc39l) is a video demo for the program.
