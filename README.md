# Medical Image Server

The program builds a medical image server. With the GUI, user can
- Upload an image
- Display an image
- Download an image
- Process an image, i.e. invert an image
- Compare two images

The server is hosted on duke vm: `vcm-14274.vm.duke.edu`. User can git clone the project and run `python client.py` to open the GUI. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h9aNJgtQ7ay0TcS8B0Wji6i-VyG1j_MW/view?usp=sharing) is a video demo for the program.
